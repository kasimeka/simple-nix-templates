          inside the dev environment:

          - run `GOMOD=$PWD/go.mod go install golang.org/x/website/tour@latest` to install the go tour
            then run `tour` to start the tour server
          - open the project in vscode & install the Go extension to start using the language server, debugger
            and formatter
          - create a Makefile to run common tasks if needed.

          this template provides a typical `mix` based elixir project with no
          declarative nix build system.

          it comes with both `elixir-ls` and `lexical` because i use both lsps
          to get a more complete experience. though, all elixir LS projects
          announced they'll merge into one,
          https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2024/08/15/welcome-elixir-language-server-team

          it also adds two QoL mix packages dependencies:

          - `credo` which is a linter that can be integrated with vscode & nvim
          - `mix_completions` which generates shell completions for mix tasks,
            `mix_completions` doesn't auto-update completions with new tasks,
            so you need to run `. <(mix complete.bash)` after adding new mix
            tasks to your project.

          - you can compile and run the project with `nix run .`
          - you can get in the dev environment with `nix develop .`

          to rename the project find and replace "kasimeka" for author name,
          "balalaika" for project name and "description goes here" for the app
          description.
